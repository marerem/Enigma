# Eingma

## Overview

The **Eingma** project focuses on analyzing visual latent factors and their influence on perception and reaction. By dissecting scenes into smaller segments, we aim to better understand how contextual elements, such as prior experiences, visual stimuli, and auditory components, shape reactions. This is particularly relevant in scenarios where subjects (e.g., primates) encounter familiar or unfamiliar patterns.

## Solution Proposal

### 1. Scene Analysis

To conduct an effective experiment, the original video content is segmented into distinct parts for easier interpretation and analysis. Key factors influencing reactions include:

- **Prior Experiences**: A subject's familiarity with patterns (e.g., human faces) may yield different responses compared to novel objects (e.g., robots in motion).
- **Auditory Influence**: Sounds can significantly alter perceptions. For example:
  - A scene with robots and humans might be interpreted as aggressive if accompanied by loud, frightening sounds.
  - The same scene may feel neutral or conversational with soft dialog-based audio.

Taking these considerations into account, the scenes have been divided as follows:

#### Segmented Scenes
1. **Scene 1**: A boy converses with a girl who has a robot arm.  
   - **Frames #**: 73  
2. **Scene 2**: The same dialogue and voices, represented as drawings.  
   - **Frames #**: 312  
3. **Scene 3**: A conversation among three people, focusing on facial expressions.  
   - **Frame #s**: 264

### 2. Audio Analysis (Optional)

If audio data is available, Fourier-domain representations of the audio for each scene would be highly beneficial. This allows us to analyze correlations between:

- **Brain Activity**: Patterns of neural response.
- **Frequency Response**: Auditory stimuli linked to specific scenes.

### 3. Sampling Plan

Given the constraints of time and resources, a subset of frames will be analyzed:

- **Selected Frames**: 1-5 frames from each video clip.
